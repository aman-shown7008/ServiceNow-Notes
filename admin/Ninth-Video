Q.  What is Business Rule?
A.  Server Side scripts when record is displayed, inserted, updated and deleted or when table is queried.
    Used to change values in the fields when specific condition is met.
    Runs on server side.
    Runs with all thw ways where record is accessed like List, Form or web services.

    Insert - So if some user is inserting the data & we want to take some action.
    Update - If some user updating some data & we want to take some action.
    Delete - If some user want to delete some data & we want to take some action.
    Query - If we click on module which shows a list of incident it's similar the query you are doing so what if you want some kind of check when user quering a data in that case we can use it.
            Ex - If I click on incident I do not want some specific users to see all the data in that case we can put query & we can put condition thats what we can do here Or may be we can put some action here.

    Role Condition -  It will decide the role of the user who will generates that event basically so a user should have that mentioned role.
                      So if there is business role which is specifically for particular role & if logged in user does not have that role then you will not run this rule.

    When to run BR - 
    Before - So if some user is inserting the data & we want to take some action. OR It runs before the record is saved to the database. We can use this to valiadate the fields.
            Ex - Let’s say you want to stop users from creating an incident without a short description.
                 Auto-set state = New if not selected.

    After - After BR excutes when form is submitted & record is updated in the database.
    | Step | What happens                                       |
    | ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | 1️⃣  | User fills the **Incident form**                   |
    | 2️⃣  | Clicks **Submit** or **Update**                    |
    | 3️⃣  | ServiceNow saves the data into the DB              |
    | 4️⃣  | Then **After BR executes**                         |
    | 5️⃣  | Now you can access the saved record, sys_id, etc.  |
    Ex - Add Comment When Category Changes.
         Auto-close Related Tasks if Incident is Resolved.

    Async - Async BR runs after record are inserted, modified OR queried. OR If you want to insert/update multiple records (like category, CI, audit logs, etc.) at the same time.

    Display - Display BR runs when data is read from the database & before presenting to the User.
              LifeCycle of Display -> 
              User opens form ➡️ Data fetched from DB ➡️ Display BR runs ➡️ Data passed to client ➡️ Client Scripts run.
              It runs on the server, but its main use is to pass data from server to client-side
              This is done using the special object: **g_scratchpad**.
              https://dev347964.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/sys_script_client.do%3Fsys_id%3D5855651fc34ea650dbc11c65e40131b8%26sysparm_view%3D%26sysparm_domain%3Dnull%26sysparm_domain_scope%3Dnull
              https://dev347964.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/sys_script_client.do%3Fsys_id%3De9e7dca3c3cae650dbc11c65e4013190%26sysparm_view%3D%26sysparm_domain%3Dnull%26sysparm_domain_scope%3Dnull
    Uses of g_scratchpad.
    Because you cannot use GlideRecord directly in client-side scripts — it’s server-side only.
    So, you use Display BR to fetch server data and pass it to Client Script using g_scratchpad.

    Order - It is sequencing of running the BR. So if you have like multiple business rule & you want to run those business rule with some sequence & you don't want all the BR should run every time then we can select this order.

    How BR Works - 
    When to run BR  ->  What action need to be taken.  ->  Action taken. 

    Global variable of BR - 
    Current - It stores current records field & values.
    Previous - If we are changing or updating a data & we want to get old values then it will be saved in previous
    g_scratchpad - If we want to get some field value from server side to client side then we can

Q.  What is GlideAggregate?
A.  GlideAggregate is a powerful server-side API in ServiceNow that allows you to perform aggregate queries like:
    COUNT(), AVG(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX()
    It's basically like GlideRecord, but optimized to retrieve summary data from the database.
    Use-Case:
    Count total incidents in system-

Q.  What is Glide Ajax.
A.  It is used to get information from server side to client side by scripts Include.
